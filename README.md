dotfiles
========

This repo contains my personalized config files for vim, bash, bash-git-prompt (and potentially others in the future).

When I start working on a new machine, I run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tschottdorf/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
and press `y` a lot.

Likely this will never be interesting for anyone who isn't me, but you never know. Feel free to copy what you like.
